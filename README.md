# World-Map-Swift
GoeJSON sample app

Touch the map and the country that contains your touch will be outlined and the name will appear in the top text field. 
You can also use the top text field to search for country to outline. Capitalization is required. 

Touching inside a country that is already outlined will pull of a list of information about that country.  

The purpose of this appp is to show how a GeoJSON object can be used. It gets all of its border polygons and country properties
